<p class="pb-1">
    In this panel, one can narrow down the subset of selected patients based on
    criteria that characterize the patient as a whole, such as HPV status or whether
    they are smokers. To do so, put the toggle buttons in one of the following three
    states:
</p>

<ul class="fa-ul pb-2" style="list-style: none;">
    <li>
        <span class="fa-li">
            <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>
        </span>
        Only patients are selected where the respective characterisitc is *positive*.
        E.g. in the case of "smoking status" this would select all smokers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="fa-li">
            <i class="fas fa-ban"></i>
        </span>
            This selection means that no filtering will be performed regarding the
            corresponding patient characteristic.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="fa-li">
            <i class="fas fa-minus"></i>
        </span>
            Selecting this will only include patients in the subset that do not have
            the respective characteristic or it is negative (e.g. not-smoking or HPV negative).
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="notification is-info is-light">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Just below the buttons there are three numbers that
    give a preview of how many of the currently selected patients can be
    categorized according to the respective characteristic. Here, the middle number
    indicates for how many patients the characteristic is unknown.
</p>

<p class="notification is-info is-light">
    <strong>Note:</strong> All filters in the Patient characteristics panel are
    combined via AND operations. This means, if one selects + for HPV status and
    - for neck dissection, the selection includes only patients who are HPV positive
    AND did not receive neck dissction.
</p>

<p class="notification is-warning is-light">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> Dont forget to hit <strong>compute</strong> after
    you have changed your selection criteria.
