Here the most important information is visualized. For each side of the neck (ipsilateral
being the same side as the tumor, contralateral the opposite) it displays a row
for each LNL. From left to right, that row consists of...

* its roman numeral label (e.g. **IV**)
* a three-way toggle-button to select a subset of patients that show metastases
in that LNL (<span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></span>) or are reported
healthy (<span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-minus"></i></span>). Selecting the
middle button (<span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-ban"></i></span>) means that
no filtering is performed
* and a horizontal stacked bar that displays the ratio of patients with reports
of <span class="tag is-danger p-1">metastases</span> in that LNL to patients that
appear to have a <span class="tag is-success p-1">healthy LNL</span>. Numbers to
the left and right of that bar plot indicate the absolute numbers and give a brief
explanation when hovering over them with the mouse pointer.

<p class="notification is-info is-light">
    <strong>Note:</strong> If for some patients the involvement in a LNL is unknown,
    these patients are represented by the <span class="tag is-info p-1">middle bar</span>.
    This may for example occur when selecting FNP is diagnostic modality, which
    is performed only in selected LNL.
