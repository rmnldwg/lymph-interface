Filter the dataset further by tumor-specific details, like the lateralization of
a patient's primary tumor, its location and/or T-category.

Next to the selected subsites and T-categories, this panel also displays how many
patients presented with a tumor in the respective subsite / T-category.

<p class="notification is-info is-light">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Both the subsites and T-categories are selected or deselected by clicking on
    the respective button. If it appears <span class="tag is-primary p-1">white on dark blue</span>,
    it is selected. If it appears <span class="tag is-primary is-light p-1">dark blue on light blue</span>,
    it is deselected. For example, selecting 'T1' and 'T2' and 'Tonsil' will select
    all patients that have primary tumors located in the tonsil AND are T1 OR T2-category,
    i.e. different criteria are combined via AND operations whereas T-categories
    are connected via OR operations.
