From left to right the three buttons here are

- the help button in light blue, opening this very menu
- an info button in light orange that shows how many patients are in the currently
narrowed-down subset and that redirects to a list of patients in that subset when
pressed
- the compute button in bright orange, which sends a request with the current selections
to the server for an update of the visualized statistics

Finally, on the left in this box one can toggle between displaying absolute numbers
or percentages.
